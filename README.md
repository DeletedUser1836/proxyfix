# proxyfix (by DeletedUser1836)
Tired of always doing always `sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf` when u want to add proxy servers during your "ethical" hacking and "pen-testing", so I made a bash script which will help a little bit by doing it much quicker

reaname it something like `proxyfix` or `proxytweaks`,put it into the **/usr/bin/** ,read the help commands, or just look at the code. If anything is not working create an issue ticket.
And pls leave me a Starâ˜†!
